# JS Tiny Test TDD Practice

In this repo, I leverage the [jstinytest](https://github.com/joewalnes/jstinytest) library to help me practice test driven development by recreating various JavaScript built-in functions.

| file | description |
| --- | --- |
| /html | HTML files that link to jstinytest & js file |
| /js | js files that replicate the built-in functions |
| README.md | About the project |
| tinytest.js | Testing library being used |

Open up the console in the HTML files to see the tests.
